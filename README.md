# reimagined-fortnight
Had an idea to use supervised machine learning to determine based on various features if i would like a particular drink. 

For now I would probably keep the beer,wine and hard liquor separate and then go through the process of seeing how it would work if they are part of a single model.

More importantly the parts of the project:
    1. REST API - backend
    2. Database schema - entities 
    3. Machine Learning - machine
    4. UI - frontend
    5. Data - data
 
This is the basic outline of the TODO's each part will probably be contained with in its own module.
